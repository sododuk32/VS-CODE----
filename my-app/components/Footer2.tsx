                1. Qualified Purchasers receive an Apple Gift Card when they
                purchase an eligible Mac or iPad at a Qualifying Location. Only
                one Apple Gift Card per eligible Mac or iPad per Qualified
                Purchaser. Offer subject to availability. While supplies last.
                Qualified Purchasers shall receive a discount equal to the value
                of the Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or
                iPad, but will be charged for all items in their cart, including
                the Apple Gift Card. Important notice regarding the checkout
                receipt and monthly statement for Apple Card Monthly Installment
                (ACMI) purchases with this promotion: Qualified Purchasers
                selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option) as payment type at
                checkout shall receive a discount equal to the value of the
                Apple Gift Card off the price of the eligible Mac or iPad. This
                will result in one ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the
                eligible iPad or Mac discounted by the instant credit, and a
                second ACMI installment plan over 12 months for the full price
                of the Apple Gift Card. The total combined amount charged over
                the two separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the
                original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately,
                Qualified Purchasers will receive and be charged for the Apple
                Gift Card in the amount of the applicable discount off the
                eligible Mac or iPad. ACMI is subject to credit approval and
                credit limit. Variable APRs for Apple Card other than ACMI range
                from 13.24% to 24.24% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of
                August 1, 2022. If you choose the pay‑in‑full or
                one‑time‑payment option for an ACMI‑eligible purchase instead of
                choosing ACMI as the payment option at checkout, that purchase
                will be subject to the variable APR assigned to your Apple Card.
                Taxes and shipping are not included in ACMI transactions and are
                subject to your standard purchase APR. See the Apple Card
